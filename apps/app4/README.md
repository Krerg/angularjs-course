## Cloaking
Normally you don't need the cloaking
But sometimes the UI is lagging / producing glitches
Usually this happen when angular scripts/modules are not that fast to load and the user sees the initial uncompiled by angular HTML state


## strict mode
`"use strict";`
just type this in and you'll get:
- First, strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
- Second, strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
- Third, strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript
