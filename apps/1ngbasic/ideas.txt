# ng created in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons
# ng first reads HTML, which uses tags and attributed, those special for ng tags are called directives
# declarative programming - for view, imperative - for business logic
# decouple dom from application logic (depends of code structuring)
# always need to think what parts of code are for UI and what - for server (thin line)
# because ng2 has components and this instead of controller - better to show ng1 as component based

# repeat will keep track of array - to optimize rerender, track-by
duplicate add 2 same objects, $id(obj)


# in conclusion - about framework in general
