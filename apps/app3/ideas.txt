dirty state (prev value) is stored in watcher - show it
dirty checking as in gradle input-output

# jira-like edit fields

# compile, link pre post, template
http://triangular.io/blog/directive-compilation-in-angularjs-step-by-step/
compile used for template DOM manipulation
link is for modifying dom, controller is for modifying state/scope
controller is used for exposing API, link can access controller via require
link is used for registring callbacks, $watch fns
controller is used when other directive needs to interact with this directive
manipulations with scope can be done in link or controller but better in ctrl for consistency reasons
