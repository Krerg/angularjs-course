# directives
there was a time when documentation was really bad now it's ok
https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive


directives can be used for:
- templating


# compile link
compile phase is to compile template; on this phase it's possible to modify the template
controller is invoked right before linking to set the scope variables
link phase it used to link template elements with some javascript code
$digest cycle is still in progress in link phase

each directive has priority of execution in case when multiple directives are on the same element
scope: false - directive uses parent scope; true -
