== Framework definition

angularjs - *single page applications*, structural framework for dynamic apps

== Data binding

It's all about data binding - most basic and impressive feature +
HTML becomes a *live template* that depicts the background javascript model +
The *ng-app* directive says that everything inside is and ng application and should become this live template

[source,html]
<html ng-app>

Any time the model is changed in the client-side model, the view reflects these changes without writing any custom code. *It just works*
 
TIP: This process is dirty checking. Dirty checking is a relatively efficient approach to checking for
changes on a model. Every time there could be a potential change, Angular will do a dirty check
inside its event loop (discussed in depth in the under the hood chapter) to ensure everything is
consistent.

*ng* uses HTML5 power to say *how the data should be displayed*

On the other side the *javascript model* in the background *is always in sync* because the binding is *bi-directional*

TIP: Bi-directional in this context means that if the view changes the value, the model
observes the change through dirty checking, and if the model changes the value, the
view update with the change.

=== DOM to model binding
The code in `{{ }}` is called an *expression* - it is *evaluated* if it's a part of the ng-app
[source,html]
<input ng-model="person.name" type="text" placeholder="Your name">
<h1>Hello {{ person.name }}</h1>

=== Model to DOM binding
To do the versa we need to write a *controller* which will be covered further; in controllers we can update the model so the view is updated as well

== Modules

Modules are containers for ng components:

* Controllers
* Services
* Directives

Advantages of using modules:

* Keeping our global namespace clean
* Making tests easier to write and keeping them clean so as to more easily target isolated
functionality
* Making it easy to share code between applications
* Allowing our app to load different parts of the code in any order

IMPORTANT: In JavaScript, placing functional code in the global namespace is rarely a good idea. It can cause
collisions that are tough to debug and cost us precious development time.

`*module*` function is a *creation function* (2 parameters) and *getter* (1 parameter) at the same time

[source,javascript]
angular.module('myApp', []) // create module
angular.module('myApp') // get the module

== Scopes

[quote, ng-book]
Scope is the *core* of any ng app
it's the *application model* or *view model* +
it's the *glue* between HTML view and javascript model +
it's the *source of truth* for the application state +

`$scope` is like in Java - the context between {}
`$scope` is hierarchical: it mimics the DOM, it's nestable
there can be parent for every scope except `$rootScope` which is always by default

=== Functions of scopes

* they have *observers* to watch the model changes
* propogate the model changes through the application (to nested scopes and directives)
* functionality isolation (isonated scopes) and properties isolation
* they are execution environment in which expressions are evaluated

Execution context is important: when the browser receives a JavaScript callback that executes inside of the Angular execution
context (check out the digest loop), the $scope will be made aware of the model mutation

NOTE: If the callback executes outside of the Angular context, we can force the $scope to have
knowledge of the change using the $apply method.

=== Scope lifecycle

* creation - when controller or directive is created, ng creates a new scope as well with `$injector`
* linking - when scope is linked all directives that create their own scopes will register *watches* to watch the propogate changes
* updating - the working phase: during $digest call on the $rootScope all scopes will check dirty, perform updates if required and propogate changes
* destruction - `scope.$destroy()` event will be broadcasted

== Expressions

Generally ng-apps can be written without any javascript, all logic can be embedded in *directives* and *xpressions*

Expressions are code blocks inside `{{ }}` notation in HTML page. 
Expressions are evaluated in a `$scope` context, so any variable from scope can be a part of an expression

Expressions in ng are pretty much the same thing as EL in *Spring* or *JSF* except the fact that they are always a part of binding - this means that whenever the property in the model changes which is a part of an expression and the `$digest` function was called on the property's scope - expression will be re-evaluated with the new property value

* All expressions are executed in the context of the scope and have access to local $scope variables.
* An expression doesnâ€™t throw errors if it results in a TypeError or a ReferenceError.
* They do not allow for any control flow functions (conditionals; e.g., if/else).
* They can accept a filter and/or filter chains.

Expressions purpose is to present the data in one way or another or write really simple controls (like setting the flag)

`$parse` service is used to evaluate expressions in the background

`$interpolate` service is used to interpolate string text containing expressions with some scope data

=== Filters for expressions

Expressions can have a pipe notation `|` after which a *filter* goes which modifies the evaluation result in some way +
There are many types of filters, for example:

*number*

[source,html]
<!-- Displays: 123.46 -->
{{ 123.456789 | number:2 }}

*date*

[source,html]
{{ today | date:'medium' }} <!-- Aug 09, 2013 12:09:02 PM -->
{{ today | date:'short' }} <!-- 8/9/13 12:09 PM -->
{{ today | date:'fullDate' }} <!-- Thursday, August 09, 2013 -->
{{ today | date:'yyyy' }} <!-- 2013 -->
{{ today | date:'MMM' }} <!-- Aug -->
{{ today | date:'hh:mm:ss.sss' }} <!-- 12:09:02.995 -->

*filter* +
The filter filter selects a subset of items from an array of items and returns a new array. This
filter is generally used as a way to filter out items for display

[source,html]
{{ ['Ari', 'Lerner', 'Likes', 'To', 'Eat', 'Pizza'] | filter:'e' }}
<!-- ["Lerner","Likes","Eat"] -->
{{ ['Ari', 'likes', 'to', 'travel'] | filter:isCapitalized }}
<!-- ["Ari"] -->

*json*

[source,html]
{{ {'name': 'Ari', 'City': 'San Francisco'} | json }}
<!--
{
"name": "Ari",
"City": "San Francisco"
}
-->

*limitTo*

[source,html]
{{ San Francisco is very cloudy | limitTo:3 }}
<!-- San -->
{{ San Francisco is very cloudy | limitTo:-6 }}
<!-- cloudy -->

You can also create a custom filter function using the `.filter(name, fun)` function on a module

== Controllers

Controller is a function which adds other helpful functions to the `$scope` when the expression language is not enough
