It’s Just HTML - both Angular-specific and non-Angular-specific

The majority of the work we’ll do in developing our Angular app is building out the functionality
of a scope.

if you have at least 1 controller - your ng-app needs a name of a module

expressions are simple things when you don't need controller
expr. are evaluated with $parse service
any text can be interpolated using $interpolate service

expressions can have filter pipe functions to modify the output / filter lists, order lists, transform numbers and dates
